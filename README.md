<h1>These scripts are meant to be run from Gamemode:</h1>
<ol>
  <li><b>desktop_black_fix.sh:</b> This script allows you to fix an annoying Desktop Mode bug which results in a black screen whenever you try to enter Desktop Mode. The script deletes the kscreen folder which contains display settings for Desktop Mode. (Note: If you unable to get to Desktop Mode to use this script, I recommend buying a USB C to HDMI adapter and connecting your Steam Deck to a monitor. Once you run this script in Desktop Mode, it will fix the issue. I recommend adding this script to Game Mode just in case the issue returns.)</li>
  <li><b>boot-movie-mover.sh:</b> This is meant for users of the Animation Changer Decky Loader Plugin. This plugin allows you to download boot movies to your Steam Deck from game mode but you can't access them using the Steam Deck's Customization settings. This script moves these boot movies from the plugin's folder to the Steam Deck's default boot movie folder.</li>
</ol>
